                <h2>History</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>In October 1886, Scotsman David Danskin and fifteen fellow munitions workers in Woolwich 
                    formed Dial Square Football Club, named after a workshop at the heart of the Royal Arsenal 
                    complex. Each member contributed sixpence and Danskin also added three shillings to help 
                    form the club.Dial Square played their first match on 11 December 1886 against 
                    Eastern Wanderers and won 6–0.The club renamed to Royal Arsenal a month later,and its 
                    first home was Plumstead Common,though they spent most of their time playing at the 
                    Manor Ground. Their first trophies were the Kent Senior Cup and London Charity Cup in 
                    1889–90 and the London Senior Cup in 1890–91; these were the only county association 
                    trophies Arsenal won during their time in South East London.In 1891, Royal Arsenal 
                    became the first London club to turn professional.</p>

                <p>Royal Arsenal renamed for a second time upon becoming a limited liability company in 1893. 
                    They registered their new name, Woolwich Arsenal, with The Football League when the club 
                    ascended later that year.[23][24] Woolwich Arsenal was the first southern member of The 
                    Football League, starting out in the Second Division and reaching the First Division in 
                    1904. Falling attendances, due to financial difficulties among the munitions workers and 
                    the arrival of more accessible football clubs elsewhere in the city, led the club close to 
                    bankruptcy by 1910.[25][26] Businessmen Henry Norris and William Hall became involved in the 
                    club, and sought to move them elsewhere</p>

                <h2>The last game</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>It felt particularly apt for Arsenal that the rain hammered down at the Etihad 
                    Stadium on their miserable return to Premier League action.
                    One hundred long days had passed since the last game in England's top-flight, 
                    but it was like the Gunners had never been away as they capitulated at the home 
                    of the champions.
                    <br>David Luiz delivered a masterclass of a 25-minute cameo off the bench, making an 
                    individual error leading to a goal, conceding a penalty and getting sent off in the 
                    process.</p>

                    <p>That accomplishment was in itself a rare feat, Arsenal had been thrashed there 
                        6-3 the previous season. In the same campaign they lost 5-1 at Liverpool.
                        If that win five years ago hinted at better things to come, they never materialised. 
                        If anything the Gunners have got worse in their rivals' back yard.
                        <br>They have now failed to win any of their last 25 games at City, Manchester United, 
                        Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham.</p>
