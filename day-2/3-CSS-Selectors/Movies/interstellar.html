                <p>Brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wrote the screenplay, which had its 
                    origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007. Christopher produced Interstellar 
                    with his wife, Emma Thomas, through their production company Syncopy, and with Lynda 
                    Obst through Lynda Obst Productions. Caltech theoretical physicist and 2017 Nobel 
                    laureate in Physics[4] Kip Thorne was an executive producer, acted as scientific 
                    consultant, and wrote a tie-in book, The Science of Interstellar. Paramount Pictures, 
                    Warner Bros. Pictures, and Legendary Pictures co-financed the film. Cinematographer 
                    Hoyte van Hoytema shot it on 35 mm in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 
                    mm. Principal photography began in late 2013 and took place in Alberta (Canada), 
                    Iceland and Los Angeles. Interstellar uses extensive practical and miniature effects 
                    and the company Double Negative created additional digital effects.</p>
                    
                <p>Interstellar premiered on October 26, 2014, in Los Angeles, California. In the United 
                    States, it was first released on film stock, expanding to venues using digital 
                    projectors. The film had a worldwide gross of over $677 million (and $701 million 
                    with subsequent re-releases), making it the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014. 
                    Interstellar received positive reviews for its screenplay, direction, themes, visual 
                    effects, musical score, emotional depth, acting, and ambition. At the 87th Academy 
                    Awards, the film won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, and was nominated for 
                    Best Original Score, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and 
                    Best Production Design.</p>
